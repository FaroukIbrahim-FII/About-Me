# LAB - 02

## About Me

I build a webpage to talk more about me and ask the user. It is a nice and simple page. For lab03 I added two questions to ask the user to input an answer and keep asking them for a specific number of iterations and provide them with a feedback if the answer was correct and a different feedback if they answered wrongly and to give them a total score for the total questions.
